# Simulations Intro Projects

The first project will be completed during the workshop while you should work on the second two over the next couple weeks till the deadline! (10/17)

2 bouncing balls graphed with matplotlib animations. One should have a horizontal velcity of ```0.1``` and the other ```0.2```. They should be dropped from ```10.0``` with a rebound coefficient of ```0.9```. Ensure they both remain on screen for at least ```10 seconds```. Use matplotlib animations in the form of the template provided.

Model a car accelerating at 2 m/s for 10 sec and then braking at 4 m/s till coming to a stop. Implement Drag in your car model ```Cross Sectional Area * drag coeff = 1.1```. You drag equation should be ```Drag = 0.5 * Cross Sectional Area * drag coeff * air density * velocity^2```. Use matplotlib animations in the form of the template provided.

Implement either a yaw model (turning model) or a motor/torque model. For starting with a motor/torque model, I recommend you research the equation ```power = torque * angular velcity of the motor``` which is often represented as ```P = Torque * RPM * 9000```. Use matplotlib animations in the form of the template provided.
